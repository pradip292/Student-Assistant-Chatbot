# Student Assistant Chatbot for College Admissions and Placements

## Project Overview
When students are considering admission to a college, they often have numerous questions, such as:
- Placement opportunities
- The highest salary packages offered
- Cut-off scores for previous years

Currently, gathering this information typically requires students to visit colleges in person, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. To address this issue, we propose a **Centralized Chatbot** that provides instant and accurate responses to these queries. This chatbot will:

- Offer comprehensive details about placements, fee structures, scholarships, and more.
- Be accessible 24/7, streamlining the admission process for students and institutions.
- Revolutionize the way students and parents explore college options by eliminating the need for personal visits or lengthy inquiries.

When students are considering admission to a college, they often have numerous questions,
such as placement opportunities, the ages of the highest salary package, and the cut-off
scores for the previous year. Currently, students need to visit colleges in person to gather
this information, which can be time-con suming and inconvenient. To address this issue,
a centralized chatbot can be introduced, allowing students to easily access all relevant
information about colleges, including placements, fee structures, scholarships, and more.
This chatbot will provide instant responses, making the admission process smoother and
more efficient for both students and institutions. By offering 24/7 assistance, the chatbot
will revolutionize the way students and parents access information, making it simpler and
more efficient to explore college options without the need for personal visits or lengthy
inquiries.
